It also highlights the essential elements of an ethical and responsible environment in which the corporate mission of 4GL can be met in an effective and efficient manner.</p>\n<h2>POLICY</h2>\n<p>As members of the 4GL organisation, we commit ourselves to the following ethical ideals:</p>\n<h3>Pursuit of Excellence</h3>\n<p>Individually and as an organisation, we seek excellence in all things.  Responsibility and accountability are the hallmarks of our organisation.</p>\n<h3>Acting with Integrity</h3>\n<p>We expect individuals to act in an honest, transparent and truthful manner.  We strive to act responsibly, accepting accountability for our conduct and supporting the responsible actions of others.</p>\n<h3>Respect for persons</h3>\n<p>We treat each person with civility, understanding and respect.  We do not unlawfully discriminate based on any status or condition protected by applicable law. We respect the inherent worth of each member of the organisation.  We do not engage in any forms of unlawful harassment of others.  Those in positions of authority, including administrators, supervisors, seniors and directors exercise their authority fairly and appropriately.  Behavior that demeans, harasses, exploits or otherwise treat individuals unfairly has no place in our organisation.</p>\n<h3>Valuing Diversity</h3>\n<p>We promote a multicultural organisation that embraces a diversity of perspectives, opinions, ideas, backgrounds and experiences.  We strive to be accepting and respectful of our differences and treat each member of the organisation with dignity and respect.</p>\n<h3>Freedom of Expression</h3>\n<p>We exercise and defend our freedom of expression within an atmosphere of open and tolerant dialogue and listen respectfully to the views of others.</p>\n<h3>Respect for the Environment</h3>\n<p>We value life in its variety and unity, and we promote a sustainable environment by responsibly using natural resources.</p>\n<h3>Life of Service</h3>\n<p>We encourage a life of service â€“ a life of compassion and justice, civic participation, and service to worthy causes and global community.</p>\n<h3>Honesty</h3>\n<p>We are committed to being truthful and trustworthy.  Lying, cheating, theft and fraud are not tolerated.</p>\n<h3>Confidentiality</h3>\n<p>We observe and respect the confidentiality rights of all members of the organisation, and this duty continues even after we are no longer affiliated with the organisation.  This right of confidentiality applies to all professional, financial, health-related, personnel, or other non-public information protected either by law or by 4GL policy.  However, the right does not preclude the consensual release of information or the disclosure of information within the organisation when there is a legitimate need for its disclosure.  Email or other uses of 4GL servers or computer networks are for business purposes only and are not presumed confidential.</p>\n<h3>Respect for company resources</h3>\n<p>We exercise due care and responsible stewardship in using company resources.  We follow proper security practices and prepare tests and documentation for our deliverables  In reporting on the use of company resources, we do not hide, conceal, or mislead; and we promptly report such misconduct when it is discovered.</p>\n<h3>Avoiding Conflicts of Interest and Commitment</h3>\n<p>We do not have direct or indirect interests or commitments, financial or otherwise, which conflict with the proper discharge of our duties to the company.  The primary professional allegiance of all employees lies with 4GL and the advancement of its mission.  We do not solicit or accept any gift, service, or favor that might reasonably influence the discharge of our duties or that we know or should know is being offered with the intent to influence our official conduct.  We do not accept other employment or engage in business or professional activities outside of the company when such work might reasonably cause real or apparent conflicts of interest or conflicts of commitment (except with prior agreement).  We do not transact business in our official capacity with any business entity of which we, or a member of our family,  are an officer, agent, or member, or in which we own a substantial interest without the explicit prior knowledge and approval of a 4GL Director.  We disclose potential conflicts of interest to the appropriate supervisor or manager as soon as possible after we realise that a conflict may have arisen.</p>\n<h3>Comply with Legal and Professional obligations</h3>\n<p>We comply with all appropriate laws and conform to the highest standards of professional conduct.  We transact company business in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and company policies and procedures.  We do not misrepresent our status or authority in our dealings with others.  To the extent that we belong to professions that are governed by standards specific to the profession, we adhere to such professional standards.  We conduct ourselves in accordance with the highest professional principles for client work, especially in terms of Transparency, Data Security, Expectation Management, and Quality of Deliverables.</p>\n<h3>Reporting Violations of the Code</h3>\n<p>In order to maintain the integrity of the organisation, we report observed or suspected violations of this code of ethics with a spirit of fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others.  Those who report alleged misconduct and those against whom allegations are reported are afforded all rights provided by 4GL policies, as well as all applicable laws.  Those who are found to have violated this code will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion, termination of employment, or termination of relationship.</p>\n<h2>HOW TO REPORT A VIOLATION OF THE CODE OF ETHICS</h2>\n<p>Reports about violations of the Code should be made with a spirit of fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others.</p>\n<p>If you become aware of any activity you feel violates policy or demonstrates a lack of ethics, you are obligated as a member of the 4GL organisation to report it.  Employees are encouraged to bring concerns directly to their manager, Human Resources (HR), or a Director as appropriate.  The company requests that a complaint be made in writing with a detailed description of the facts giving rise to the complaint, the names of any individuals involved, including any witnesses, and copies of any documents that support or relate to the complaint.</p>\n<p>Further, you can anonymously and confidentially report any issue online using the regular <a href=\"/contact\">contact form</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ethics Policy","description":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
