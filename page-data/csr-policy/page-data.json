As a result, our approach evolves as we learn lessons along the way. </p>\n<p>Our policy we have divided it into four key areas:</p>\n<h2>Community</h2>\n<p><em>Connecting &#x26; educating SAS users around the world</em></p>\n<p>We proactively support SAS User Communities and we aim to make the SAS communities in which we operate better places. We encourage and empower our employees to get involved with their local SAS communities and use their skills and where possible the Companyâ€™s resources to help create a mutual benefit.</p>\n<h2>People</h2>\n<p><em>Finding, supporting and developing great people throughout their 4GL journey</em></p>\n<p>We strive to ensure all colleagues enjoy their work and have opportunities to consistently amaze our customers through their friendly expertise. As such, we continue to invest in development programmes and actively look for ways in which we can promote and increase the diversity of our workforce.</p>\n<h2>Environmental Management</h2>\n<p><em>Managing our impact on the environment in a responsible and ethical manner</em></p>\n<p>ALL work has some impact on the environment and we have a duty to manage that impact in a responsible and ethical manner. We do this through identifying all significant environmental impacts and putting processes into place to prevent, reduce and mitigate them. This also makes good business sense.</p>\n<h2>Responsible Trading</h2>\n<p><em>Building and maintaining the highest standards amongst our partners and suppliers</em></p>\n<p>We are committed to maintaining high standards amongst our partners and suppliers. We oppose the exploitation of workers and we will not tolerate forced labour, or labour which involves physical, verbal or psychological harassment, or intimidation of any kind. We will <a href=\"/slavery-statement/\">not accept human trafficking</a> or the exploitation of children and young people in our business and undertake all reasonable and practical steps to ensure that these standards are maintained.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CSR Policy","description":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
